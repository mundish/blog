In my efforts to learn python, I've been spending some time on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) doing katas.
Apart from being a good place to come across problems to solve,
Codewars also lists top voted solutions for katas which are a great source for learning some new tricks.

One such trick I've picked up is the following:

```python
def create_phone_number(n):
  return "({}{}{}) {}{}{}-{}{}{}{}".format(*n)

create_phone_number([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```

This function will take an array `n` consisting of 10 integers (0-9) and return them in the format _(012) 345-6789_.

So how does this work?

Well, there's two (fairly basic) main concepts here: the [`format`-method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format)
and the [`*`-operator](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists).

The `format`-method interpolates each of the arguments passed into the corresponding _replacement field_ (`{}`) in the target string.

In the function `create_phone_number` above, `n` is an array, which with the help of `*` is "unpacked",
or split into a series of single arguments passed into the function.

If you're familiar with [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
in JavaScript this should be familiar.

This is cool and all, but passing that phone number as an array feels cumbersome, don't you think?

Not a problem, since (like with _spread_ ) we can unpack strings too:

```python
def format_phone_number(n):
  return "({}{}{}) {}{}{}-{}{}{}{}".format(*n)

format_phone_number("0123456789")
```

That's nicer!

To wrap up, here's a couple of examples for other cases where this could be a suitable solution:

```python
def format_date(date):
    # YYYY-MM-DD
    return "{}{}{}{}-{}{}-{}{}".format(*date)

def format_swedish_personal_id_number(n): # YYYYMMDD-XXXX
    return "{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}-{}{}{}{}".format(*n)
```
